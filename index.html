					<p>My preschool years were spent crawling around in a four-family flat on Arsenal, half a block east of Grand and Tower Grove Park. I do have some memories from these years, including hot summer nights with the windows open and a fan on high, trying to piece together dinner that didn't involve turning on the oven or stove.</p>

					<p>From age 5 to 18 I live in a suburb on the far southrn edge of the St. Louis metropolitan area. It was just what you probably expect: subdivisions, baseball teams, big box stores, and lots of TV. Most of my fond memories from these years involve my family. Pictured here are my brother, mother, and grandfather.</p>

					<h2>Portillos</h2>
					<p>We come to the present day. After leaving New York in 2008, I returned to St. Louis, this time planing my feet within the city limits for the first time. Over the years I lived in a few different parts of the city, including Dogtown and Old North, but I've spend the majority of my time in the city in the Cherokee / Jefferson area, at various apartments in Benton Park and Gravois Park.</p>
